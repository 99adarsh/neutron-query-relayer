# Description
Interchain query relayer implementation for Cosmos

Makes interchain queries possible.
For example there is blockchain N that needs to make query to blockchain T.
N -> T

Blockchain N submits an interchain query with needed params and so on.

Relayer sees the incoming event from blockchain N and:
1. Tries to parse it from list of supported queries
2. If successful, gets proofs for all the needed data for query
3. If successful, submits transaction with proofs back to blockchain N

Blockchain L can then verify the result for the query.

# Running

## Running in development

#### natively
1. set env from env list via way you prefer (e.g. `export $(grep -v '^#' .env.example | xargs)` )
2. `make dev`

#### in Docker
currently `neutron` is a private repo, so you need to run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`
*note*: we're going to remove this after making all our repos public
1. Build docker image 
`make build-docker`
2. Run
`docker run --env-file .env.example -v $PWD/../neutron/data:/data -p 9999:9999 neutron-org/cosmos-query-relayer`
note: this command uses relative path to mount keys, run this from root path of `cosmos-query-relayer`
note: with local chains use `host.docker.internal` in `RELAYER_NEUTRON_CHAIN_RPC_ADDR` and `RELAYER_TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_ADDR` instead of `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`

## Running in production
!!! TODO: full info on how to run in production

note: consider to change  `RELAYER_NEUTRON_CHAIN_RPC_ADDR` & `RELAYER_TARGET_CHAIN_RPC_ADDR` to actual rpc addresses
- `RELAYER_TARGET_CHAIN_HOME_DIR` `RELAYER_NEUTRON_CHAIN_HOME_DIR` also need to be changed (keys are generated in `terminal 1`)

# Logging
We are using [zap.loger](https://github.com/uber-go/zap)
By default, project spawns classical Production logger. so if there is a need to customize it, consider editing envs (see .env.example for exapmles)
